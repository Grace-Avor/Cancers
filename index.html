      Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and
      spread of abnormal cells in the body. These abnormal cells can form
      tumors, invade nearby tissues, and, in some cases, metastasize (spread to
      other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system).
      Cancer can affect virtually any organ or tissue in the body and can be
      life-threatening if not treated.
