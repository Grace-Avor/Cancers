        <h1>what is cancer?</h1>
        <p>
          Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth
          and spread of abnormal cells in the body. These abnormal cells can
          form tumors, invade nearby tissues, and, in some cases, metastasize
          (spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or
          lymphatic system). Cancer can affect virtually any organ or tissue in
          the body and can be life-threatening if not treated.

          <h3 class="types-of-cancer-header">
            There are more than 100 different types of cancer, and they are
            generally categorized based on the type of cells where they
            originate. Some common types of cancer include:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <ol>
              <h3>
                1. Carcinomas: These cancers originate in epithelial cells,
                which line the surfaces of organs and tissues. The most common
                carcinomas include:
              </h3>
              <li>Breast cancer</li>
              <li>Lung cancer</li>
              <li>Prostate cancer</li>
              <li>Colorectal (colon and rectal) cancer</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
              <h3>
                2. Sarcomas: Sarcomas develop in connective tissues like bones,
                muscles, and cartilage. Examples include:
              </h3>
              <li>Osteosarcoma (bone cancer)</li>
              <li>Leiomyosarcoma (smooth muscle cancer)</li>
              <li>Liposarcoma (fat tissue cancer)</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
              <h3>
                3. Leukemias: Leukemias affect the blood and bone marrow,
                leading to the overproduction of abnormal white blood cells.
                Types of leukemia include:
              </h3>
              <li>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)</li>
              <li>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)</li>
              <li>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)</li>
              <li>Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
              <h3>
                4. Lymphomas: Lymphomas originate in the lymphatic system, which
                is part of the immune system. Common lymphomas include:
              </h3>
              <li>Hodgkin lymphoma</li>
              <li>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
              <h3>
                5. Central Nervous System (CNS) Cancers: These cancers affect
                the brain and spinal cord and can include:
              </h3>
              <li>Glioblastoma</li>
              <li>Medulloblastoma</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              6. Melanoma: Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that originates in
              melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in the skin.
            </p>

            <p>
              7. Carcinoid Tumors: These tumors typically develop in the
              digestive tract, lungs, or other organs that have neuroendocrine
              cells.
            </p>

            <p>
              8. Germ Cell Tumors: Germ cell tumors usually start in the
              reproductive organs, such as the testicles and ovaries.
            </p>

            <p>
              9. Multiple Myeloma: This cancer affects plasma cells in the bone
              marrow and can lead to bone damage and other complications.
            </p>

            <p>
              10. These are just a few examples, and there are many other less
              common types of cancer as well. Each type of cancer may have its
              own unique characteristics, risk factors, symptoms, and treatment
              options. Early detection and timely treatment are critical for
              improving outcomes in cancer patients.
